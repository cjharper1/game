Create a thread for the physics simulation.

Create a wrapper class for the window.

Window has a get event method that returns a boost::optional. With boost::none corresponding to no event.

Events are sent to the physics thread as often as they are collected by the window into a buffer.

The physics thread only takes the most recent event off the buffer as input.
